      During my time at Dispace as a software engineer, I had the opportunity to
      contribute to the building of a web application that services the event
      management sector. The application was built using various technologies
      such as Typescript, React, APS.NET, Microsoft SQL Server, and Azure cloud
      platform. The development team operated in an agile environment with
      bi-weekly sprints.

      Another achievement that I made was introducing style templates with
      documentation to the codebase to improve its readability. The templates I
      introduced helped to standardize the coding style of the application,
      making it easier for other developers to understand and work with the
      codebase. This improved the overall quality of the codebase and allowed
      the team to work more efficiently.
